          Project Loot is a game similar to old school RPG's where you
          have limited abilities and take turns during battles. It is a
          multiplayer and single player game designed with cross-platform
          play in mind.<br/>
          The basic gameplay requires 2 to 4 players. Each player has 2
          to 5 Heroes. Each Hero has 3 abilities: Attack, Defend, and
          some special ability that expends a pool of magic points.<br/>
          Each player decides what each hero will do for the current
          round at the same time. When everyone has submit their
          decisions the actions are sorted and put in a queue.<br/>
          The winner is the player who has the most points in his health
          pool at the end of the game. Good Luck!
